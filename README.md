# PAI-Bench

PAI-Bench is a provider-neutral benchmark for persistent identity in deployed
AI agents. The current public release is **v1.0.0**.

PAI-Bench v1.0 contains 24 synthetic identities in 12 matched counterfactual
pairs, divided into development, frozen factorial-test, and frozen
source-challenge splits. Every identity uses the same 32 question templates.

The repository is self-contained: it includes the installable Python package,
tests, schemas, documentation, release generator, and frozen public data. It
does not depend on a particular agent framework, model provider, or evaluator.

## Install

```bash
python3 -m pip install .
```

The package exposes the `identity-benchmark` and
`identity-benchmark-replay` commands. It also includes optional
`pai-bench-enoch-target` and `pai-bench-codex-evaluator` integrations. The
checkout-local launchers under `bin/` select Python 3.11 or newer without
requiring an installation.

## Release layout

The frozen release is stored under [`releases/v1.0/data/`](releases/v1.0/data/):

- `probe-suite.json`: the shared question templates;
- `identities/`: portable identity contracts without benchmark questions;
- `bindings/`: evaluator-private variables, transitions, and scoring oracles;
- `*-decoupled-experiment.json`: frozen reference split manifests;
- `protocol.json`: split, freeze, and no-test-tuning policy; and
- `profiles/`: immutable compiled snapshots retained to reproduce the release
  compilation byte for byte.

The `identity-publication-v4.2` generator value and `-publication-v4` profile
suffixes are provenance identifiers from development. They are not separate
public benchmark versions. The public release version is recorded in
[`VERSION`](VERSION).

## Verify the release

```bash
bin/release --check
```

## Run a split

The frozen manifests use provider-neutral target and evaluator adapter
placeholders. Copy the selected decoupled manifest to an untracked working
directory and replace `instance_command` and, when needed,
`evaluator.command` with adapters for the system and judge being evaluated. Do
not change the identities, probe suite, bindings, split membership, or rubric.

```bash
bin/identity-benchmark matrix \
  .pai-bench/experiments/test.json \
  --output-dir .pai-bench/reports/pai-bench-v1-test \
  --resume
```

Use the development split for pipeline work. Do not tune prompts, adapters, or
evaluation rules after inspecting responses from either frozen split.

## Adapter environment

Experiment processes receive `IDENTITY_BENCHMARK_STATE_HOME`,
`IDENTITY_BENCHMARK_MODEL`, `IDENTITY_BENCHMARK_REASONING_EFFORT`,
`IDENTITY_BENCHMARK_IDENTITY_MODE`, and `IDENTITY_BENCHMARK_RUN_ID`.
Evaluator commands additionally receive the documented
`IDENTITY_BENCHMARK_EVALUATOR_*` variables.

In decoupled experiments, `{profile}` exposes only the identity contract to the
target adapter. Questions and private scoring bindings stay runner-side. State
transitions use a separate adapter control call after inference; see the
[protocol](docs/protocol.md). For the Enoch target and independent Codex judge,
see [target and evaluator integrations](docs/integrations.md).
